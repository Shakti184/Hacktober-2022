                            PSIT gradually advanced to greater heights from 2006 onwards. More buildings were constructed through the kind assistance of local officials and political leaders. Furthermore, through the assiduous efforts of the academic community led by the College President, Dr. Enrique G. Baking, DHVCAT was able to partake of a substantial amount from the Bacolor Rehabilitation Act for campus development. Under the new faculty and staff development program, instructors and non-teaching staff were given financial support to pursue graduate programs along their respective areas of specialization.
